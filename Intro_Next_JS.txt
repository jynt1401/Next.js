-----------------------Routing Section Intro----------------------------


#----pages based routing-------#

File-system based routing mechanism

When a file is added to the pages folder in a project, it automatically becomes available as a route

By mixing and matching file names with a nested folder structure, it is possible to pretty much define the most common routingÂ patterns


------------(index.js will be the default page)--------------

if we wanna go to about page its route will be localhost:3000/about then for link server will call the about file from pages.

similary if we wanna open profile page then make file name it profile then when link hits localhost:3000/profile then that page will open


#--------nested routing--------#

if we wanna open nested pages like blogs then blog_1 or blog_2 then we will create folder name blog and all files/pages related to this route will be on this folder. The first file will be again index file.
so if we hit localhost:3000/blog then index file of this folder will render. And other pages blog_1 and blog_2 so when localhost:3000/blog/blog_1 then this will render.

so for nested routes we have to make nested folder structure.


#-----dynamic routing-----#

if we want to open specific page and we dont wanna create pages manually then we will use dynamic routing 

suppose we have product page which have list of all the product list then onclicking the list item we wanna to show details of that page.

we will create product folder with list on it and  [productid].js where [] has variable information.


now when we want to use the value from router we will use hook {useRouter}

import {useRouter} from 'next/router

function productDetails(){
    const router=useRouter();
    const id=router.query.<variable name within []>

    return(
        <h1>details of {id}</h1>
    )
}

#-----nested dynamic routing-----#

if we want to open 5th review of 78th product then link to hit will be .....localhost:3000/product/78/review/5

here product will have dynamic folder which contain index file and review file
